## Game Rules
After you run the game enter the number of players(2 - 8). Enter a name for each player and start eating brains!

### On your turn you can:
- `roll`: to roll the Zombie dice;
- `finish`: to end your turn.
### About the dice
There are three types of dice in three colors(6 green dice, 4 yellow dice and 3 red dice):
green dice - 3xðŸ§ 2xðŸ’¥1xðŸ‘£
yellow dice - 2xðŸ§ 2xðŸ’¥2xðŸ‘£
red dice - 1xðŸ§ 2xðŸ’¥3xðŸ‘£
- ðŸ§  - you ate your victim's brain! When face on the drawn dice has this symbol, you win 1 point for your current turn. Your current points are added to your total points after the end of your turn(this is when you type `finish`).
- ðŸ’¥ - he fought back! If you rolled three shotguns, your turn is over and your current points are lost. Otherwise, you can choose to stop and score `finish`, or continue `roll`.
- ðŸ‘£ - your victim escaped. When one or more drawn dice has a face with this symbol, they will be included in the next `roll` authomatically. You should be very careful with this symbol. Why? Because of the color of the dice.

### End of the game
Game is finished when one of the players first scores 13 points.
